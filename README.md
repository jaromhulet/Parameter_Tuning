# Parameter_Tuning
Parameter Tuning with Metaheuristics

This code explores the effictiveness of using various metaheuristic algorithms for parameter tuning.

The first experimentation will be done on a test dataset with the XGBoost algorithm in sklearn.  

The goal is to create a generalized code base that will consistently beat grid search and random search both in performance and number
of models ran in the tuning process.
